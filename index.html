            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>Hey my name is Jacob Jensen! my friends have always called me Jake or JJ when I used to play sports like soccer and football my teammates called me J Twice. I have been interested in coding since I was in high-school. After I graduated I went to Arizona to go to college but I decided that it wasnt for me and decided I wanted to travel for a while. I moved to Montana, then Taiwan, and then to cambodia. I spent about 3 months in each place. I finally decied to move home to portland and try to do school again and Epicodus was right for me. </p>

            <p>I have worked since I was 15 years old starting as a preschool teacher, I also worked nights at a icecream shop in vancouver. Working and having a good work ethic has always been really important to me. After I moved back home from college I started working at costco, then a stone masonry and finally at a small cafe called Boomerang.<br><br><br>
